# Integrating Django and React

1. Existing project - HTML rendered with Django backend.
Pick one "page" / feature and you build out that feature in its own project.

2. React project inside the Django project.
(e.g. https://github.com/getsentry/sentry)

3. Separate them -> Django API and React frontend hosted separately.
